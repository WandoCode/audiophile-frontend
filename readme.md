# Main features

- Developped with a headless CMS for backend (Strapi) (manage text and images)
- Used Cloudinary to store images
- Used a DB to make Starpi datas persistent
- The cart is persistent (via local storage)

NB: I used a personal (diffrent than the given one) design for tablet/mobile menu.
