# Main features

- Developped with a headless CMS for backend (Strapi): manage text and images
- Used Cloudinary to store images
- Used a DB to make Starpi datas persistent
- The cart is persistent via local storage

NB: I used a personal design (different than the given one) for tablet/mobile menu.
